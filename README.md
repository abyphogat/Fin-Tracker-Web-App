# **BUILD INSTRUCTIONS**
1. First run the backend using following steps from the project root folder:

    ```
    > cd backend
    # generate jar file for the backend
    > mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests=true
    # run the jar file
    > java -jar ./target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dspring.datasource.url=<database_url> -Dspring.datasource.username=<database_username> -Dspring.datasource.password=<database_password>
    ```
    Backend service will start running on http://localhost:8080

    Note: database url looks like: jdbc:mysql://<domain_name>:3306/<database_name>

2. Run the frontend service using following steps from the project root folder:

    1. create .env file same as [.env.sample](./frontend/.env.sample) under [frontend](/frontend/) and provide base url of the backend service
        Note: For localhost the base url will be http://localhost:8000 
    2. run the following code:
        
        ```
        > cd ./frontend
        > npm install
        > npm start
        ```
    
    Note: The frontend service will start running on http://localhost:3000

<br/>
<br/>

# **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

`build-backend` and `build-frontend` jobs in [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) generates all the artifacts needed to deploy the backend and frontend

* Download the artifacts of `build-backend` job
* The `.jar` to run the backend service is saved under `backend/target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` path in the artifact
* Upload the `.jar` file on the server and run, 

    ```
    > java -jar ./target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dspring.datasource.url=<database_url> -Dspring.datasource.username=<database_username> -Dspring.datasource.password=<database_password>
    ```

* Download the artifacts of `build-frontend` job
* The `build` files to run the frontend service is saved at `frontend` path in the artifact
* Upload entire `build` folder to the server and run,

    ```
    > serve -s build
    ```

**Note**: The build artifact for the frontend service is only configured to call the backend service running at http://172.17.1.244:8080 (network address of the deployment server). If the backend service is running at different ip then change `BACKEND_API_URL`
variable in the Gitlab CI/CD configurations. The resolution of the limitation is to assign domain name to the backend service and provide that as the value of `BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable in GitLab CI/CD configuration.


<br/>
<br/>

# **GitLab Jobs**
* `build-frontend`: Builds deployment artifacts for the frontend service
* `build-backend`: Builds deployment artifacts for the backend service
* `test`: Run all the unit tests and integration test in the backend and generates **Jacoco** report
* `smell-check`: Run the Designite tools and generates artifacts of smell reports
